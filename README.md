# AI Beginner Projects

Welcome to my **AI Beginner Projects** repository! This repository documents my journey through various AI and machine learning projects. Each project represents a key learning milestone as I explore different AI concepts and challenges on my path to becoming an AI Engineer.

## Projects:

### 1. [Simple MNIST Image Classification](./Simple_MNIST_Image_Classification)
- A basic neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification. This project covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, offering a solid foundation for beginners.

### 2. [Movie Sentiment Analysis](./Movie_Sentiment_Analysis)
- This project uses various machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and LSTM to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. It focuses on text preprocessing and model comparisons.

### 3. [House Price Prediction](./House_Price_Prediction)
- A regression-based project predicting house prices using models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. The dataset contains multiple house features, with a focus on model optimization.

### 4. [CIFAR-10 Image Classification](./CIFAR10_Image_Captioning)
- A CNN model classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories. This project delves into data augmentation, model architecture, and performance evaluation for image classification tasks.

### 5. [Facial Expression Recognition](./Facial_Expression_Recognition)
- A CNN model trained to recognize facial expressions from labeled images. It covers preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, showcasing how deep learning can identify emotions in images.

### 6. [Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM](./Bitcoin_LSTM_Forecasting)
- This project uses LSTM networks to predict Bitcoin prices based on historical data. It demonstrates the use of RNNs for time-series forecasting, offering insights into financial market prediction.

### 7. [MNIST Handwritten Digit Generation with GANs](./MNIST_GAN_Digit_Generation)
- A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) project aimed at generating handwritten digits. It highlights adversarial training, covering generator and discriminator models for image generation.

More projects will be added as I continue my learning journey in AI and machine learning!
