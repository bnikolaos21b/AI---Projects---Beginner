# AI Beginner Projects

Welcome to my **AI Beginner Projects** repository! Here, I’m documenting my journey as I learn and apply various AI and machine learning concepts. Each folder contains a specific project that showcases key learning milestones in my path toward becoming an AI Engineer.

## Projects:

1. [Simple MNIST Image Classification](./Simple%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification)
   - This project demonstrates image classification using a basic neural network with the MNIST dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluating the results.

## About Me:
I’m Nikos, an aspiring AI Engineer, and this repository serves as a portfolio of my work and learning progress. I’m excited to share my journey with others and hope that these projects can inspire fellow beginners in AI!

Stay tuned as I continue to add more projects and grow my understanding of AI and machine learning!
