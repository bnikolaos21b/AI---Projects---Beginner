# AI Beginner Projects

Welcome to my **AI Beginner Projects** repository! Here, Iâ€™m documenting my journey as I learn and apply various AI and machine learning concepts. Each folder contains a specific project that showcases key learning milestones in my path toward becoming an AI Engineer.

## Projects:

1. [Simple MNIST Image Classification](./Simple%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification)
   - This project demonstrates image classification using a basic neural network with the MNIST dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluating the results.

2. [Movie Sentiment Analysis](./Movie%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
   - This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using three models: **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **LSTM**. It demonstrates text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time sentiment prediction on new reviews.

Stay tuned as I continue to add more projects and grow my understanding of AI and machine learning!
