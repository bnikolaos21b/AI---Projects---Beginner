# Simple MNIST Image Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of image classification using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 images of handwritten digits for training and 10,000 for testing. The neural network is built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

### Key Concepts:
- Data Preprocessing: How to prepare image data for the neural network.
- Building a Neural Network: Designing a simple fully connected (dense) network.
- Training: Understanding how to train a model using a training dataset and optimize its accuracy.
- Evaluation: Measuring model performance on unseen data.

## Files:
- **ImageClassification.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code for training the model and evaluating its performance.
- **sample_image.jpg**: An example image used for testing the model.

## Running the Project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to see how the model is built and trained.
